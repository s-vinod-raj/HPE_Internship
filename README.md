Here's a combined README you can add to your repository root to explain the project clearly:


---

üìö WIKI-KAFKA-ELASTICSEARCH PIPELINE

This project implements a real-time streaming pipeline using Kafka and Elasticsearch. It fetches recent edits from Wikipedia, streams the data via Kafka, and indexes it into Elasticsearch for querying and visualization.

üöÄ Components

1. wiki_producer.py

A Python script that pulls live Wikipedia edit data using the Wiki EventStream API.

Sends events to a Kafka topic.



2. wiki_stream_processor.py

A Python script that consumes data from Kafka and processes or transforms it.

Sends clean data to Elasticsearch for indexing.



3. docker-compose.yml

Brings up the infrastructure:

Apache Kafka

Zookeeper

Elasticsearch

(Optional) Kibana for visualization




4. README kafka.md

Details on how to configure and run the Kafka setup.



5. README elasticsearch.md

Instructions to connect and manage the Elasticsearch component.
